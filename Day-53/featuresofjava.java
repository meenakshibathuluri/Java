features of java :
1.simple : pointers and multiple inheritances.
pointers means : a pointer is a variables that stores the memory address of another variable.
multiple inheritances : multiple inheritances is a feature of object oriented programming.

object oriented : deals with the real time object.
they are 7 type :
1.class
2.object
3.inheritances
4.encapsulation
5.interface
6.abstraction
7.polymorphism

2.multithreading :
we can execte multiple threads at a time. multithreading is a programming concept where a single program or process can execute multiple threads or flow.

3.platforms independnt :
if we write code in any operating system and execte this code in another operating system results will be same

4.WORA : write once and run anywhere.

5.portable :
when we write a java program the code frist get converted into bytecode and this bytecode does not depend on any operating system or any specific computer.
we can simply execte this bytecode on any platforms with the help of jvm.

6.robust and security :
java compiler will show the errors during compiltion. in the  context of software or system robust refers to the ability. 
security refers to the measures taken to protect a system application and data.

7.scalable : 
 using java we can build small and large project refers to the ability of a system application or process.

8.intrepreted :
 jvm is used to intrepret the byte code into machine executable code. 
 refers to a programming language or code that is executed directly by an interpreter at runtime, without prior compilation into machine code.

9.memory management :
garabage collectors and deallocate the memory.memory management refer to the process of managing computer memory ensoring that
1.memory is allocated
2.memory is deallocated
3.memory is optimized
