//widening type casting: converting the small datatype into large datatype
//byte we can store in short,int,long,float,double and we cannot store boolean,char.
//short  we can store in int,long,float,double and we cannot store boolean,char,byte.
//int  we can store in int,long,float,double and we cannot store boolean,char,byte.
//long we can store in long,float,double and we cannot store boolean,char,byte,int.
//float becasuse float is a decimal number and we should not store decimal value in int,long and float value can store in double
//double bbecasuse double is a decimal number
